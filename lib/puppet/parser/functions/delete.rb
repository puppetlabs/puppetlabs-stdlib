    @summary
      Deletes all instances of a given element from an array, substring from a
      string, or key from a hash.

    For example:

      ```delete(['a','b','c','b'], 'b')```
      Would return: `['a','c']`

      ```delete({'a'=>1,'b'=>2,'c'=>3}, 'b')```
      Would return: `{'a'=>1,'c'=>3}`

      ```delete({'a'=>1,'b'=>2,'c'=>3}, ['b','c'])```
      Would return: `{'a'=>1}`

      ```delete('abracadabra', 'bra')```
      Would return: `'acada'`

      > *Note:* from Puppet 4.0.0 the minus (-) operator deletes values from arrays and
      keys from a hash:

        ```['a', 'b', 'c', 'b'] - 'b'```
        Would return: `['a', 'c']`

        ```{'a'=>1,'b'=>2,'c'=>3} - ['b','c'])```
        Would return: `{'a' => '1'}`

    A global delete from a string can be performed with the
    [`regsubst`](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/function.html#regsubst) function:

      ```'abracadabra'.regsubst(/bra/, '', 'G')```
      Would return: 'acada'

    In general, the built-in [`filter`](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/function.html#filter)
    function can filter out entries from arrays and hashes based on keys and/or values.

    @return [String] The filtered String, if one was given.
    @return [Hash] The filtered Hash, if one was given.
    @return [Array] The filtered Array, if one was given.
