Puppet::Type.newtype(:file_line) do
  desc <<-EOT
    Ensures that a given line is contained within a file.  The implementation
    matches the full line, including whitespace at the beginning and end.  If
    the line is not contained in the given file, Puppet will append the line to
    the end of the file to ensure the desired state.  Multiple resources may
    be declared to manage multiple lines in the same file.

    Example:

        file_line { 'sudo_rule':
          path => '/etc/sudoers',
          line => '%sudo ALL=(ALL) ALL',
        }

        file_line { 'sudo_rule_nopw':
          path => '/etc/sudoers',
          line => '%sudonopw ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL',
        }

    In this example, Puppet will ensure both of the specified lines are
    contained in the file /etc/sudoers.

    Match Example:

        file_line { 'bashrc_proxy':
          ensure => present,
          path   => '/etc/bashrc',
          line   => 'export HTTP_PROXY=http://squid.puppetlabs.vm:3128',
          match  => '^export\ HTTP_PROXY\=',
        }

    In this code example match will look for a line beginning with export
    followed by HTTP_PROXY and replace it with the value in line.

    Examples With `ensure => absent`:

    This type has two behaviors when `ensure => absent` is set.

    One possibility is to set `match => ...` and `match_for_absence => true`,
    as in the following example:

        file_line { 'bashrc_proxy':
          ensure            => absent,
          path              => '/etc/bashrc',
          match             => '^export\ HTTP_PROXY\=',
          match_for_absence => true,
        }

    In this code example match will look for a line beginning with export
    followed by HTTP_PROXY and delete it.  If multiple lines match, an
    error will be raised unless the `multiple => true` parameter is set.

    Note that the `line => ...` parameter would be accepted BUT IGNORED in
    the above example.

    The second way of using `ensure => absent` is to specify a `line => ...`,
    and no match:

        file_line { 'bashrc_proxy':
          ensure => absent,
          path   => '/etc/bashrc',
          line   => 'export HTTP_PROXY=http://squid.puppetlabs.vm:3128',
        }

    Note that when ensuring lines are absent this way, the default behavior
    this time is to always remove all lines matching, and this behavior
    can't be disabled.

    Encoding example:

        file_line { "XScreenSaver":
          ensure   => present,
          path     => '/root/XScreenSaver',
          line     => "*lock: 10:00:00",
          match    => '^*lock:',
          encoding => "iso-8859-1",
        }

    Files with special characters that are not valid UTF-8 will give the
    error message "invalid byte sequence in UTF-8".  In this case, determine
    the correct file encoding and specify the correct encoding using the
    encoding attribute, the value of which needs to be a valid Ruby character
    encoding.

    **Autorequires:** If Puppet is managing the file that will contain the line
    being managed, the file_line resource will autorequire that file.
