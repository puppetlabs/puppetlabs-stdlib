## Overview

This module provides a standard library of resources for Puppet modules.

## Module Description

Puppet modules make heavy use of this standard library. The stdlib module adds the following resources to Puppet:

 * Stages
 * Facts
 * Functions
 * Defined types
 * Data types
 * Providers

> *Note:* As of version 3.7, Puppet Enterprise no longer includes the stdlib module. If you're running Puppet Enterprise, you should install the most recent release of stdlib for compatibility with Puppet modules.

## Setup

[Install](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/modules_installing.html) the stdlib module to add the functions, facts, and resources of this standard library to Puppet.

If you are authoring a module that depends on stdlib, be sure to [specify dependencies](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/modules_installing.html) in your metadata.json.

## Usage

Most of stdlib's features are automatically loaded by Puppet. To use standardized run stages in Puppet, declare this class in your manifest with `include stdlib`.

When declared, stdlib declares all other classes in the module. This currently consists of `stdlib::manage` and `stdlib::stages`.

The `stdlib::stages` class declares various run stages for deploying infrastructure, language runtimes, and application layers. The high level stages are (in order):

  * setup
  * main
  * runtime
  * setup_infra
  * deploy_infra
  * setup_app
  * deploy_app
  * deploy

Sample usage:

```puppet
node default {
  include stdlib
  class { java: stage => 'runtime' }
}
```

The `stdlib::manage` class provides an interface for generating trivial resource declarations via the `create_resources` parameter.  Depending on your usage, you may want to set `hiera`'s `lookup_options` for the `stdlib::manage::create_resources:` element.

```yaml
---
stdlib::manage::create_resources:
  file:
    /etc/somefile:
      ensure: file
      owner: root
      group: root
  package:
    badpackage:
      ensure: absent
```

## Reference

#### `Stdlib::IP::Address`

Matches any IP address, including both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. It will match them either with or without an address prefix as used in CIDR format IPv4 addresses.

Examples:

```
'127.0.0.1' =~ Stdlib::IP::Address                                # true
'10.1.240.4/24' =~ Stdlib::IP::Address                            # true

```

#### `Stdlib::IP::Address::V4`

Match any string consisting of an IPv4 address in the quad-dotted decimal format, with or without a CIDR prefix. It will not match any abbreviated form (for example, 192.168.1) because these are poorly documented and inconsistently supported.

Examples:

```
'127.0.0.1' =~ Stdlib::IP::Address::V4                                # true

'FEDC:BA98:7654:3210:FEDC:BA98:7654:3210' =~ Stdlib::IP::Address::V4  # false
'12AB::CD30:192.168.0.1' =~ Stdlib::IP::Address::V4                   # false
```

Valid values: An IPv4 address.

#### `Stdlib::IP::Address::V6`

Match any string consisting of an IPv6 address in any of the documented formats in RFC 2373, with or without an address prefix.

Examples:

```
'127.0.0.1' =~ Stdlib::IP::Address::V6                                # false
'10.1.240.4/24' =~ Stdlib::IP::Address::V6                            # false
'FEDC:BA98:7654:3210:FEDC:BA98:7654:3210' =~ Stdlib::IP::Address::V6  # true
'FF01:0:0:0:0:0:0:101' =~ Stdlib::IP::Address::V6                     # true
'FF01::101' =~ Stdlib::IP::Address::V6                                # true
```

Valid values: An IPv6 address.

#### `Stdlib::IP::Address::Nosubnet`

Valid values: An IP address with no subnet.

#### `Stdlib::IP::Address::V4::CIDR`

Match an IPv4 address in the CIDR format. It will only match if the address contains an address prefix (for example, it will match '192.168.0.6/24'
but not '192.168.0.6').

Valid values: An IPv4 address with a CIDR provided eg: '192.186.8.101/105'. This will match anything inclusive of '192.186.8.101' to '192.168.8.105'.

#### `Stdlib::IP::Address::V4::Nosubnet`

Match an IPv4 address only if the address does not contain an address prefix (for example, it will match '192.168.0.6' but not '192.168.0.6/24').

Valid values: An IPv4 address with no subnet.

#### `Stdlib::IP::Address::V6::Full`

#### `Stdlib::IP::Address::V6::Compressed`

Match an IPv6 address which may contain `::` used to compress zeros as documented in section 2.2.2 of [RFC 2373](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2373.txt). It will match addresses with or without an address prefix as documented in section 2.3 of [RFC 2373](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2373.txt).

#### `Stdlib::IP::Address::V6::Nosubnet`

## Development

Puppet modules on the Puppet Forge are open projects, and community contributions are essential for keeping them great. We can’t access the huge number of platforms and myriad hardware, software, and deployment configurations that Puppet is intended to serve. We want to keep it as easy as possible to contribute changes so that our modules work in your environment. There are a few guidelines that we need contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on top of things. For more information, see our [module contribution guide](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-stdlib/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

To report or research a bug with any part of this module, please go to [https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-stdlib/issues](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-stdlib/issues).
